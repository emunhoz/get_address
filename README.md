## Find Address with Google Maps and ViaCep [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/51b73283-26e2-4b59-805e-a6bf399d6219/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/findaddress/deploys) ![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/emunhoz/get_address?style=social)

#### About this app

- At the begining I setup Prettier, ESLint and EditorConfig code patterns
- For the components I decided to use styled-components to style, because it keep the code very clean and it's very friendly
- For testing I've used `testing library` to integration tests and `cypress` to e2e
- For requests I decided to use axios cause is very simple to use
